    title: "This sounds complicated. I bet this is complicated, right?",
    question:
      "What we do is complicated. What you do is really really not. Just answer a few questions, and we’ll build an investment portfolio with your name on it. Then, as soon as your money arrives, we invest it just like we said we would. Bada bing, etc.",
  },
  {
    title: "What if I don’t like your picks? Can I choose my own investments?",
    question:
      "Yup. You can customize your Wealthfront portfolio six ways to Sunday, both when you’re first opening a new account or at any point afterwards.",
  },
  {
    title: "What if I want to pull my money out?",
    question: "Well, it’s your money, so you can withdraw it at any time.",
  },
  {
    title: "I bet this is really expensive.",
    question:
      "That’s not a question, but actually no. The weighted average annual expense ratio of the investments of a taxable Wealthfront portfolio is between 0.05–0.29%. Wealthfront also charges a 0.25% annual advisory fee, but for more than 96% of our clients with a recommended portfolio, that’s covered by Tax-Loss Harvesting.",
  },
  {
    title: "Tax-loss what now?",
    question:
      "Tax-Loss Harvesting. It’s a way to take advantage of changes in the market to help reduce your tax bill and give you more money to invest. For most clients, it generates savings worth at least 11 times our advisory fee, which means your tax savings more than pay for our fee.",
  },
  {
    title: "I love everything about this. How do I give you my money?",
    question:
      "We make it easy! Electronic bank deposit, wire transfer or account transfer from your brokerage to Wealthfront.",
  },
  {
    title: "But I’ve already got investments somewhere else.",
    question:
      "Again, that’s not a question. But you don’t always need to sell your investments to move them. We make the transfer process free, simple, and tax-efficient.",
  },
  {
    title: "How is this different than investing in the S&P 500?",
    question:
      "Investing in the S&P means only investing in US equities. Fortunately for us, the world is bigger than that. We use 10 global asset classes to diversify your investment and better weather anything the market throws at you.",
