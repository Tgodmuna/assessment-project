          The effectiveness of the Tax-Loss Harvesting strategy to reduce the
          tax liability of the client will depend on the client’s entire tax and
          investment profile, including purchases and dispositions in a client’s
          (or client’s spouse’s) accounts outside of Wealthfront Advisers and
          type of investments (e.g., taxable or nontaxable) or holding period
          (e.g., short- term or long-term).Tax loss harvesting may generate a
          higher number of trades due to attempts to capture losses. There is a
          chance that trading attributed to tax loss harvesting may create
          capital gains and wash sales and could be subject to higher
          transaction costs and market impacts. In addition, tax loss harvesting
          strategies may produce losses, which may not be offset by sufficient
          gains in the account and may be limited to a $3,000 deduction against
          income. The utilization of losses harvested through the strategy will
          depend upon the recognition of capital gains in the same or a future
          tax period, and in addition may be subject to limitations under
          applicable tax laws, e.g., if there are insufficient realized gains in
          the tax period, the use of harvested losses may be limited to a $3,000
          deduction against income and distributions. Losses harvested through
          the strategy that are not utilized in the tax period when recognized
          (e.g., because of insufficient capital gains and/or significant
          capital loss carryforwards), generally may be carried forward to
          offset future capital gains, if any.
